## Other applied-academic Claude Code resources

### Highest priority

- **[Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham — Claude Code mini-series at Princeton](https://bcf.princeton.edu/events/paul-goldsmith-pinkham-mini-series-on-claude-code-for-applied-economists/)** *(March 2026, Markus' Academy, 5 episodes)*. Applied-econ angle. Topics: getting started, data analysis (Census), web scraping (SEC EDGAR), large datasets (Parquet/DuckDB), writing & thinking. **The most authoritative public material on this topic for our field.**
- **[Claes Bäckman — Claude Code in VS Code, For Academic Economists](https://claesbackman.com/claude-code-guide.html)** — Written practical guide (~3,500 words). Setup → recommended extensions (R / Stata / Python / LaTeX) → file formats → CLAUDE.md and skills → git → performance. **Recommended companion** to this talk: written-form, IDE-focused, complementary to Goldsmith-Pinkham's video format.
- **[Aniket Panjwani — YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNWk2F6OuWR-UdWF1GzEVCQ)** *(ongoing, 2026)*. Northwestern PhD economist. Free 3-hour course for beginners + practical videos: *[AI Agents for Economic Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPv9BqweQIo)*, *[Should economists use Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cIlJlypOAI)*, plus a Stata-specific guide. Pairs well with Goldsmith-Pinkham — different teaching style, more tool-comparison content. Site: [aniketpanjwani.com](https://aniketpanjwani.com/).
- **[Mihail Velikov — AI in Business & Economic Research wiki](https://velikov-mihail.github.io/ai-econ-wiki/)** *(Penn State Smeal, ongoing)*. Curated knowledge base, ~147 articles organized into 10 sections: Foundations, Prompt Engineering, AI Agents, Claude Code Skills, Data Analysis, Academic Publishing, Finance & Econometrics, Tool Comparisons, Institutional, Productivity. **The best single landing page if you want one curator's reading list across the whole space.**

### Forks of `claude-code-my-workflow`

- **[`hugosantanna/clo-author`](https://github.com/hugosantanna/clo-author)** — Hugo Sant'Anna's authoring-side fork. 30+ journal profiles, theorist agents, worker-critic pairs. **Source of `/checkpoint` and `/review-paper --peer` patterns** (used with permission).

### Standalone community skills

- **[`jusi-aalto/strategic-revision`](https://github.com/jusi-aalto/strategic-revision)** — DAG-based peer-review response planning. Different approach than `/respond-to-referees` (Part 6); worth knowing about as an alternative for complex R&R rounds.
- **[`jusi-aalto/crossref`](https://github.com/jusi-aalto/crossref)** — Bibliography validation against the Crossref REST API. Returns canonical APA citations + DOIs + match confidence.

### Adjacent ecosystem

- **[`chrisblattman/claudeblattman`](https://github.com/chrisblattman/claudeblattman)** — Chris Blattman's guide for non-technical academics. Less code-heavy, more workflow-heavy.
- **[`scunning1975/MixtapeTools`](https://github.com/scunning1975/MixtapeTools)** — Scott Cunningham's TikZ + Rhetoric of Decks materials. **Source of our TikZ infrastructure.**
- **[`karpathy/autoresearch`](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch)** — Andrej Karpathy's constraint-based autonomous-research experiment. Aspirational; different shape than ours.

### B-school / MBA-specific

- **[AI MBA](https://ai-mba.io)** — Curriculum + tutorials targeting business-school audiences. Specific recommendations:
  - **[Skills vs MCPs tutorial](https://ai-mba.io/tutorials/skills-vs-mcps)** — Direct follow-up to Part 3.
  - [Example curriculum (PDF)](https://ai-mba.io/example-curriculum.pdf) — Course-design reference for faculty teaching AI in B-school programs.

## Cross-tool

- **[Codex plugin for Claude Code](https://community.openai.com/t/introducing-codex-plugin-for-claude-code/1378186)** *(OpenAI Developer Community, 2026)*. Built by VB Srivastav and the OpenAI team. Three use cases: standard Codex review, adversarial review, second-pass delegation. **Source of the `/codex:adversarial-review` pattern shown in Part 7.**
- **[`codex-setup.md`](codex-setup.md)** *(this repo)* — step-by-step install + first-use guide for the Codex plugin in VS Code. Marketplace add → plugin install → `/codex:setup` → `!codex login` → first adversarial review. **Print or bookmark; this is the practical companion to the Part 7 cross-tool slides.**

---

## Replication-policy references (Part 5)

- **[AEA Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy)** — official policy + Data Editor process.
- **[AEA Data Editor (LDI replication lab)](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/)** — what they do, what they check, examples.
- **[AEA RCT Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org)** — required since 2018 for AEA-journal field-experimental work.
- **[OSF (Open Science Framework)](https://osf.io/registries)** — preregistration default for survey experiments.
- **[AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org)** — 9-question short-form preregistration.

### Selected field-specific journal policies

- **[Review of Economic Studies replication policy](https://academic.oup.com/restud/pages/general_instructions)** — REStud requires data + code at acceptance.
- **[Quarterly Journal of Economics replication policy](https://academic.oup.com/qje/pages/general_instructions)** — QJE follows the AEA Code policy.
- **[Journal of Political Economy replication policy](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jpe/replication-policy)** — JPE's policy.

For finance + accounting journal policies, refer to the journals' own author-instruction pages directly — those policies are evolving rapidly.

## Methodology references (cited inline in the deck)

- **Dhuliawala, S. et al.** (2023). *Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models.* [arXiv:2309.11495](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495). Source of the CoVe / `/verify-claims` pattern.
- **Stock, J. & Yogo, M.** (2005). *Testing for Weak Instruments in Linear IV Regression.* In Andrews, D.W.K. (ed.), *Identification and Inference for Econometric Models*. Source of the F > 10 weak-instrument heuristic referenced in Part 6's demo.
- **Andrews, I.** (2026). *Some Thoughts on AI and Research.* [MIT note, April 3 2026](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2026-04/IA%20AI%20note_1.pdf). Source of the "bottleneck has shifted from generating output to evaluating it" framing in Part 1.

### Field-level framing on AI agents in economics

These don't appear in the deck but are the most useful one-stop reads on *why* agentic AI matters for economics research, written by economists for economists.

- **Korinek, A.** (2025). *AI Agents for Economic Research.* [NBER Working Paper 34202](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34202). The canonical "where the field is" piece. Documents what agents do well (literature review, code generation, data analysis, workflow orchestration) and what they don't.
- **Grundl, S.** (2026). *Claude Code as an Empirical Economist: Like Humans but Without the Tails.* [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6219138). Compares Claude Code (Opus 4.5) to human economists on causal inference tasks under matched instructions. Reports + code at [claude-code-economist.com](https://claude-code-economist.com).
- **Yin, Z. et al.** (2024). *Should We Respect LLMs? A Cross-Lingual Study on the Influence of Prompt Politeness on LLM Performance.* [arXiv:2402.14531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14531). Empirical micro-result: impolite prompts hurt LLM performance, but extreme politeness doesn't help — there's a middle band, and it varies by language.

## Tools used in the talk

- **[Quarto](https://quarto.org)** — slide rendering. Specifically `clean-revealjs` extension by Grant McDermott: [github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean).
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/install)** — the agent runtime. Install: `claude.ai/install`.
- **[`fixest`](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/)** — R package for high-dimensional fixed effects. The R script in Demo 4 uses `feols`.
- **[NetworkX](https://networkx.org)** — Python graph library. Used by `strategic-revision` for DAG validation.

## Three things to do, by priority

If you're going to do *one* thing this week:

> **Write a `CLAUDE.md` for your next paper.** 30 minutes. The whole rest of this stack pays off from there.

If you have a free Saturday morning:

> **Watch Goldsmith-Pinkham's [first 2 episodes](https://bcf.princeton.edu/events/paul-goldsmith-pinkham-mini-series-on-claude-code-for-applied-economists/) and clone [`Claude-Mini`](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/Claude-Mini).** Different teaching style, different angle — much faster to internalize the pattern with two takes.

If you have a complex R&R with many interlinked concerns:

> **Try [`jusi-aalto/strategic-revision`](https://github.com/jusi-aalto/strategic-revision) before your next response letter.** Different approach than `/respond-to-referees` — DAG-based dependency mapping that surfaces which concerns block which others.
